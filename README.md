# PSDK Online Server

A lightweight, dependency-minimal HTTP + WebSocket server for PSDK multiplayer features. Built with native Node.js HTTP, the `ws` library, MongoDB via Mongoose, and zero web framework overhead.

---

## Features

### 🔐 Authentication

All requests are protected by a shared API key (`x-api-key` header for HTTP, `?apiKey=` query param for WebSocket). A separate admin key (`x-admin-key`) gates sensitive endpoints such as Mystery Gift administration and telemetry data.

### 👥 Friends

- Send, accept, decline, and cancel friend requests
- List current friends and pending requests
- Remove a friend

### 🔄 GTS (Global Trade System)

- Deposit a creature with a trade request (species + level range)
- Browse all active deposits
- Execute a trade between two players
- Configurable species blacklist and automatic expiry (TTL via MongoDB)

### 🎁 Mystery Gifts

- **Internet gifts** — publicly listed, claimable by any connected player
- **Code gifts** — redeemed with a secret code
- Supports creatures, eggs, and items (with quantity) in a single gift
- Per-gift validity window (`validFrom` / `validTo`), claim limit, and player whitelist
- Full admin API: create, update, activate/deactivate, delete gifts

### 🏦 PokéBank

- Per-player cloud storage organised in boxes and slots
- Configurable box count (`POKEBANK_MAX_BOXES`) and box size (`POKEBANK_BOX_SIZE`)
- Deposit and withdraw creatures; server treats creature data as opaque (no schema lock-in)

### ⚡ WebSocket — Real-time

- Single `/ws` endpoint shared with HTTP (same port)
- Player authentication on connection (`playerId` + `apiKey` as query params)
- Automatic session replacement when the same player reconnects
- **Battle** — challenge, accept/decline, move exchange, flee, result
- **Trade** — request, accept/decline, item exchange, confirm, cancel
- Keepalive with `PING` / `PONG`

### 📊 Telemetry Dashboard

Built-in, zero-dependency monitoring available at `http://localhost:<PORT>/telemetry`.

- Live counters: HTTP requests, WebSocket connections, DB queries, errors
- Per-route latency histograms (7 buckets: <10ms → ≥1000ms, min/max/avg)
- Per-WS-message-type breakdown
- Rolling 24-hour hourly snapshots (persisted to MongoDB every 5 minutes)
- Ring buffer of the last 200 events (HTTP, WS, DB, errors)

### 📖 Swagger / OpenAPI

Auto-generated API documentation at `http://localhost:<PORT>/api-docs` — no external service required.

### 🩺 Health Check

`GET /health` returns `{ status: "ok", uptime: <seconds> }` with no authentication required. Suitable for load balancer and uptime monitor probes.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** ≥ 22
- **MongoDB** ≥ 8
- **Docker** (optional but recommended for deployment)

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values:

```env
# Server
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production

# MongoDB — full URI used directly by Mongoose
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/psdk_online

# Auth — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
API_KEY=change_me_with_a_strong_random_key
ADMIN_KEY=change_me_with_a_different_strong_key

# GTS
GTS_SPECIES_BLACKLIST=       # comma-separated species IDs, e.g. 150,151
GTS_EXPIRY_DAYS=30

# PokéBank
POKEBANK_MAX_BOXES=8
POKEBANK_BOX_SIZE=30
```

> `API_KEY` and `ADMIN_KEY` must be different values. The admin key should never be shared with game clients.

---

## Running with Docker (recommended)

### Full stack — server + MongoDB

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The server waits for MongoDB to pass its healthcheck before starting.

### Server only — external MongoDB

If you already have a MongoDB instance, update `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env`, then:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.server-only.yml up -d
```

### Useful commands

```bash
# View live logs
docker logs -f psdk_online_server

# Open a shell inside the container
docker exec -it psdk_online_server sh

# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (⚠️ deletes all data)
docker compose down -v
```

---

## Running locally (no Docker)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode (hot reload via tsx)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

Logs are written to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log` alongside console output.
